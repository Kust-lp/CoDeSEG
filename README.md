# Comprehensive, Efficient Large-Scale Community Detection via Structural Entropy Game
## Quick start
We have published CoDeSEG on PyPI. Below are the installation and usage examples:
```bash
pip install codeseg
```
```python
from codeseg import CoDeSEG

in_path = "Input file of graph edge list"
out_path = "Output file of communities"
comms = CoDeSEG(in_path, out_path)
```

## Note
### Build Requirements
- CMake >= 3.22
- gcc/g++ >= 9
- Python >= 3.8


### data format
The format of the input edge list file is as follows:
```python-repl
   1 \t 2 \n
   1 \t 3 \n
   2 \t 3 \n
    ...
``` 
For dynamic graphs, the input should be a folder containing edge list files for each network snapshot, stored in the /data/ntwk directory. The file structure is as follows:
```kotlin
<your_dataset>/ 
├── ntwk 
    ├── 1.txt
    ├── 2.txt
    ├── 3.txt
    ...
```

In addition, we provide the source code for all algorithms. The relevant details are as follows:
